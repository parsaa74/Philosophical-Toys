    year: 1850,
    description: 'A geometric object representing the platonic ideal of symmetry and mathematical beauty.',
    category: 'mechanical',
    image: '/globe.svg',
    perceptualArgument: 'The dodecahedron, as Plato described, is a symbol of the cosmosâ€”its symmetry a metaphor for the harmony of the universe and the underlying mathematical structure of reality.',
    historicalContext: 'Associated with Plato\'s cosmology, representing the element of the universe or cosmos itself. Its form has fascinated mathematicians and philosophers for centuries.',

    description: 'A device that produces the illusion of motion by displaying a sequence of drawings or photographs.',
    category: 'optical',
    video: '/zoetrope-loop.mp4',
    perceptualArgument: 'Demonstrates how a sequence of static images creates the illusion of continuous motion, a foundational principle of cinema and a commentary on constructed reality.',
    historicalContext: 'Invented in the 1830s by William George Horner, the Zoetrope was a popular parlor toy that showcased the persistence of vision, a key step in media archaeology towards cinema.',

    description: 'An optical device that projects an image of its surroundings on a screen.',
    category: 'optical',
    image: '/window.svg',
    perceptualArgument: 'Reveals the fundamental optical principle of image projection, questioning the directness of perception by showing how light forms inverted images.',
    historicalContext: 'Known since antiquity (e.g., Mozi in China, Aristotle in Greece) and formally described by Ibn al-Haytham, it was crucial for developments in optics, art, and early photography.',

    inventor: 'Joseph Plateau',
    year: 1832,
    description: 'An early animation device that used the persistence of vision principle to create an illusion of motion.',
    category: 'optical',
    perceptualArgument: 'The phenakistoscope demonstrates the cyclical nature of perception and the construction of movement from stillness, highlighting the active role of the viewer in creating motion.',
    historicalContext: 'Invented by Joseph Plateau around 1832, it was one of the first devices to create a fluid illusion of motion, relying on stroboscopic effects.',

    inventor: 'Athanasius Kircher',
    year: 1650,
    description: 'A musical instrument that is played by the wind, exploring the relationship between nature and sound.',
    category: 'sound',
    image: '/file.svg',
    perceptualArgument: 'Explores the aesthetic possibilities of chance and natural forces in creating sound, challenging notions of authorship and intentionality in art.',
    historicalContext: 'Described by Athanasius Kircher in the 17th century, these instruments were popular in Romanticism for their evocation of natural, ethereal music.',

    year: 1824,
    description: 'A simple optical toy that demonstrates the persistence of vision through a spinning disk with images on both sides.',
    category: 'optical',
    perceptualArgument: 'A simple yet profound demonstration of how the brain merges two distinct images into a single, coherent one when presented in rapid succession, illustrating the synthetic nature of vision.',
    historicalContext: 'Popularized in the 19th century by John Ayrton Paris, it\'s a classic example of an optical toy based on the persistence of vision.',
